# Modules-Week-3-Assignment

In this assignment, two linear voltage regulators have to be created. One must be adjustable, and the other needs to be constant. These can be created with the schematic layout in DipTrace, and then a hierarchy block can be created for both to easily use them for other projects.

The LM317LBZRAG was used for the adjustable regulator, the datasheet for the part is here which contains the schematic: https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/on-semiconductor/LM317LBZRAG/9086547
This is a low current, 3 pin regulator which only requires two resistors to set the output voltage. The simplified application schematic on the first page of the datasheet was replicated in Diptrace. After replicating the schematic, the entire schematic can be condensed into a hierarchy block to be used for bigger projects. This is done by selecting objects -> place block. This block can be imported into a new sheet on the same file or saved and imported into a new project in DipTrace.

The ___ was used for the constant regulator, the datasheet for the part is here which contains the schematic:
The same process was followed for recreating the schematic and exporting it as a hierarchy block.
